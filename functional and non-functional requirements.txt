Fitness app

v1.0
The main idea is to be able to create training routines at the user's request.
You need to create exercise, by muscle group and specific muscle.
Each exercise must allow an example video.
A routine consists of choosing the number of total series, then you can add as many muscle groups as total series.
If you don't add the max muscle group, you should be able to choose how many sets of that group you want to do.
I want to edit the final training, change some exercise, number of repetitions
To filter exercises, I want to be able to choose, muscle group, specific muscle, and the item that exercise uses. e.g. elastic band
Needs to store the created workout, and ones saved i want to be able to edit it.
I want to be able to print the routine ones its finish.
An exercise of a set need reps or time, rest and weight if need it.
If possible i want the routines to be separated on types of routines (crossfit, tabata, ...)
